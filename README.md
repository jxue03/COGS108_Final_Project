• This project examines the relationship between mental health treatment facilities and jail admission rates across California counties (2020–2024), exploring whether expanding mental health infrastructure could ease pressure on the incarceration system.  
• By integrating data on jail admissions, licensed mental health facilities, demographics, income, and unemployment, regression analysis revealed a consistent negative correlation: counties with more mental health facilities tended to have lower jail admission rates. While not proving causation, the findings suggest that expanding mental health services—alongside broader social support—may reduce incarceration and better support vulnerable populations.
