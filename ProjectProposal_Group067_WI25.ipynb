    "Our question was born from a prior COGS 108 guest lecture by DJ Patil, where he discussed the Data-Driven Justice Initiative (DDJ). The DDJ is an initiative that is working to reduce recidivism – the tendency of someone previously incarcerated to reoffend and end up back in jail again – for those struggling with mental health crises. Many people are continuously cycling in and out of jail for low-level offenses, largely due to mental health issues and substance abuse. According to https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/datadrivenjustice, about 64% of these people are dealing with mental illness, and about 68% are dealing with substance abuse. Significant taxpayer money is being spent on cycling individuals in and out of jail, but more importantly, these people are stuck in a never-ending loop of incarceration that could be addressed with mental health services. This system worsens their mental health, narrowing their opportunities and stripping away chances for stability and reintegration. Instead of support, they face punishment, leaving them with fewer options and a higher chance of returning to jail.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDJ was implemented in 2016 under the Obama administration, and has appeared to succeed since its implementation. For example, according to this article https://medium.com/@ObamaWhiteHouse/launching-the-data-driven-justice-initiative-disrupting-the-cycle-of-incarceration-e222448a64cf, by training officers in Miami on mental health de-escalation, the police have since been able to accomplish over a 5-year span: “diverted more than 10,000 people away from jail and into treatment”, only have 109 arrests resulting from 50,000 calls for mental health crises, dropped the jail population by 40% and even closed an entire county jail facility, and drop recidivism rates from 72% to 20% for those receiving mental health treatment. Knowing all of this, we want to find out if the number of mental health resources affects the amount of people going to jail in an area.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some research available online related to suvey about mental health service, for example, \"National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS)\" which is conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), \n",
    "provides comprehensive data on the location, characteristics, and services of mental health treatment facilities across the U.S<a name=\\\"samhsa.gov\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). This includes both inpatient and outpatient services at the county level. On the other hand, we found another source on \"Vera Institute of Justice’s Incarceration Trends Dataset\", it provides \n",
    "detailed visualization of historical data on incarceration rates at the state level, including jail and prison populations in each state, and the proportion of males and females within the population<a name=\\\"https://trends.vera.org/\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). It allows for analysis of trends over time and comparisons across counties. One thing we notice is this report not only analyzed the gender \n",
    "but also the proportion of different race of people getting in jails. We can then consider if the mental health cases rise depends on gender and race, which can also be another valuable data to include in.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that counties with greater availability of mental health treatment facilities will have lower incarceration rates, particularly after 2016. We believe this effect will be more pronounced in areas with a higher amount of mental health crisis intervention facilities because they provide immediate alternatives to jail for individuals with mental health needs. Our predictions are largely based on the implementation of the Data-Driven Justice Initiative in 2016, which aimed to reduce jail recidivism by diverting individuals with mental health conditions toward treatment rather than incarceration. If the initiative was successful, we expect to see a stronger negative correlation between mental health facility availability and incarceration rates in the years following its implementation (post 2016).\n",

    "The research question is considering if the availability of mental health treatment facilities correlates with lower incarceration rates in California, so the ideal dataset could include observations and variables regarding 1) The incarceration rate per 100,000 population, 2) Recidivism rates to count how many individuals return to jail after their first incarceration and the reasons for it. 3) The different types of incarceration(i.e. Mental health issues, burglary, drug abuse, non-violent crimes, etc.). \n",
    "It is also important to consider the number of mental health services and facilities per 100,000 people, number of trained mental health professionals/therapists in the area, access to mental health resources, number of psychological/psychiatric impatient beds, and funding.\n",
    "Besides, check the number of arrests made related to mental health issues, the number of criminals redirected to mental health centers from jail per year in the area.\n",
    "Look at how economic/covid-19, poverty rate, unemployment rate, education levels contribute to mental crisis and crime rate, and including the comparison between urban vs rural areas.\n",
